compiled VS interpreter language: both
1. Java can be considered both a compiled and an interpreted language because its source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code. This byte-code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is usually a software-based interpreter.

* Comparable:it is an interface and implemented by class. It have a method compareTo which can be used to compare itself to an object.
* Comparator is a interface which have a method compare which compare two objects. it can be used with sort method to sort in a specific order

* Volatile key word: with the help of this keyword read/write will be done from main memory instead of cpu catch memory, can only be used on field variable
* synchronized;can be used on both method and call, read and write done directly from memory
* Atomic
* StringBuffer and StringBuilder: string buffer is thread safe while while stringBuilder is not
* static: static variable and static are executed in the same way as they are present in the program
* static variable: declared at class level and this value is shared between all the objects of this class
* static block: part of class rather the  then instance of the class, we can call it without an object of the class, cant access the data which is not static,dont have access to instance variable
* Final class: we cant extend final class
* Final variables: can change the value of a variable in/ prevent inheritance  
* Final method: cant override the method

### exception vs error: 
* error cause by problems that are outside the control of the program ex: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError 
* Exception: used to handle the recoverable errors in the program
* checked exception: compile time exception
* Unchecked exception: runtime exception <br>

* Synchronized
* asynchronized
* How a program compile and run?
* Difference between stack and heap
* abstract method and class
* Dom and Sax interface
* is java call by value or call by referance
* child parent assignemt varilable
